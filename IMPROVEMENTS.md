# Suggestions for PressMage Improvements

## Graceful shutdown of the worker thread
The `BotWorker.run` loop runs indefinitely and only yields via `time.sleep`, even after `stop()` is called; closing the window simply flips `_running` to `False` without breaking the loop or stopping the `QThread`. Adding a request flag that exits the loop and invoking `thread.quit()/thread.wait()` from `MainWindow.closeEvent` would avoid dangling background threads during shutdown and make unit testing easier.【F:PressMage.py†L320-L371】【F:PressMage.py†L440-L458】【F:PressMage.py†L495-L512】【F:PressMage.py†L994-L1000】

## Avoid recomputing edge templates each iteration
When Canny-based matching is enabled, each cycle recomputes `cv2.Canny` for every template, which is expensive. Caching an edge version of each template (e.g., prepared when `set_params` is called) would substantially cut CPU usage inside the hot loop.【F:PressMage.py†L346-L407】

## User-friendly handling of missing Windows-only dependencies
`run_gui_app` imports many Windows-specific modules unconditionally. On non-Windows hosts this raises `ImportError` before the app can explain the requirement. Wrapping the imports in platform checks and surfacing a clear dialog would improve diagnostics and allow the CLI/core parts to run cross-platform.【F:PressMage.py†L109-L132】

## Enrich error logging from the worker loop
The worker currently logs only the exception message, losing stack details that would help diagnose detection issues. Capturing `traceback.format_exc()` alongside the message or routing errors through the existing colored log helper would make support incidents easier to investigate.【F:PressMage.py†L448-L451】

## Extend coverage of the queue engine tests
The embedded unit tests exercise only two happy paths. Adding cases for deduplication, invalid directions, and `pending_count` would protect the core input queue against regressions as timing rules evolve.【F:PressMage.py†L18-L104】【F:PressMage.py†L1009-L1050】
